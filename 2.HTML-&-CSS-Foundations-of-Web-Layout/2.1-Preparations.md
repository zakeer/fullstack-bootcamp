### ✅ Step-by-Step: Install & Setup

#### 1. **Install VS Code (Code Editor)**

* Visit: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Download and install the editor for your OS
* Open the editor

> 💡 Tip: VS Code is lightweight, fast, and has a large extension ecosystem.

#### 2. **Install "Live Server" Extension**

This lets you preview your HTML pages with live reloading.

* In VS Code, go to **Extensions (Sidebar)**
* Search for **Live Server**
* Click **Install**

> 💡 After installing, right-click your HTML file → “Open with Live Server”

#### 3. **Set Up Folder Structure**

Create a folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir web-basics
cd web-basics
```

Inside this folder, create:

```
web-basics/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── images/
```

## ✍️ Write Your First HTML & CSS

#### 📄 `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>My First Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
  <p>This is your first webpage!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

#### 🎨 `styles.css`

```css
body {
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}
```

---

### 🖥️ Preview the Page

Right-click on `index.html` in VS Code and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.

Your browser should open a page that says:

```
Welcome to Web Development
This is your first webpage!
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts to Understand

| Concept           | Explanation                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Tells the browser you are using HTML5            |
| `<head>`          | Contains metadata (not visible on the page)      |
| `<body>`          | Everything visible goes here                     |
| `<link>`          | Connects the CSS file to the HTML page           |
| CSS Selectors     | Like `body`, `h1`, they apply styles to elements |

### 🧪 Quick Practice Task

1. Add another heading below the first one: `<h2>Let's build something awesome!</h2>`
2. Update your CSS to make `h2` blue.

```css
h2 {
  color: blue;
}
```

Save and check the preview!

### 🧼 Best Practices

* Always separate structure (HTML) and style (CSS)
* Use consistent file and folder names (no spaces!)
* Use proper indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
* Keep your editor and extensions updated
